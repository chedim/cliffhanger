# Application interface
Cliffhanger applications interact with the environment using application interfaces.
Application interfaces consist of input and output data streams that are represented as plurals.

```cliff
keypresses are press keyboard inputs
mousemoves are move mouse inputs
mouseclicks are click mouse inputs
leftmouseclicks are left click mouse inputs 

windows are window outputs
stdouts are text terminal outputs
```

## Native inputs and outputs

## User interactions
IO manager should define
